All the logic is in handling the nodes and loading of the nodes.\\r\\n  It is based on the assumption that the data gets populated from an api call and the api can handle returning a specific child subset of data and also returns the total amount.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n  The base logic behind this implementation is to compare the nodes returned and the nodes shown to figure out if there are more nodes that can be loaded.\\r\\n  If there are nodes not yet loaded we add a special node to the result before returning the result to the tree.\\r\\n  If we already loaded nodes we need to remove the old special load more node and add the results.\\r\\n  To show the loading process we change the name of the node that was clicked into a loading indicator.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Node type</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n  One way to differentiate nodes we added from normal nodes is to introduce a type.\\r\\n  In the example we have an enum with only one entry, the <code>loadMore</code> type because it's the only one we need.\\r\\n  The tree itself will not care about this property on each or some nodes and will not rewrite or remove it.\\r\\n  We can use this type to check what to do when we click on a node. On our <code>loadMore</code> node we need to load data, on a normal node we maybe need to load or show different data.\\r\\n  The example has no custom templating, but we can also use this type to display different types of nodes with a different style.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n  Besides the <code>loadMore</code> with the handling shown in the example we can also add an <code>error</code> type.\\r\\n  If the api calls fails for some reason usually the tree will open a node - but show no results and the user has no opportunity to reload the data.\\r\\n  Instead of just returning the error we could catch it and add a special error node.

For example - click on the node activates / deactivates it, click on the expander expands / collapses it, pressing space or enter will toggle the node activation (same as click), etc.</p>\\r\\n<p>Using the <code>actionMapping</code> option, you can override how the tree reacts to mouse and key events, by providing a custom mapping.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<code-example>{{ actionMapping }}</code-example>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>actionMapping (IActionMapping)</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The <code>actionMapping</code> attribute needs to implement the <code>IActionMapping</code> interface, which is an object that maps predefined mouse events, and key codes, to callbacks.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>The callback (IActionHandler)</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The callback always receives three parameters: <code>TreeModel</code>, <code>TreeNode</code>, and <code>$event</code>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>TREE_ACTIONS</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Notice the <code>TREE_ACTIONS</code> object. It holds predefined callbacks that do common actions.</p>\\r\\n<p>The available attributes are:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li><code>TOGGLE_ACTIVE</code></li>\\r\\n    <li><code>TOGGLE_ACTIVE_MULTI</code></li>\\r\\n    <li><code>ACTIVATE</code></li>\\r\\n    <li><code>DEACTIVATE</code></li>\\r\\n    <li><code>TOGGLE_SELECTED</code></li>\\r\\n    <li><code>SELECT</code></li>\\r\\n    <li><code>DESELECT</code></li>\\r\\n    <li><code>FOCUS</code></li>\\r\\n    <li><code>TOGGLE_EXPANDED</code></li>\\r\\n    <li><code>EXPAND</code></li>\\r\\n    <li><code>COLLAPSE</code></li>\\r\\n    <li><code>DRILL_DOWN</code></li>\\r\\n    <li><code>DRILL_UP</code></li>\\r\\n    <li><code>NEXT_NODE</code></li>\\r\\n    <li><code>PREVIOUS_NODE</code></li>\\r\\n    <li><code>MOVE_NODE</code></li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Mouse actions</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In mouse actions, the <code>TreeNode</code> parameter of the callback is the node that the event was activated on (e.g. clicked on).</p>\\r\\n<p>The possible attributes for <code>actionMapping.mouse</code> are:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li><code>click</code></li>\\r\\n    <li><code>dblClick</code></li>\\r\\n    <li><code>expanderClick</code></li>\\r\\n    <li><code>checkboxClick</code></li>\\r\\n    <li><code>contextMenu</code> (right click)</li>\\r\\n    <li><code>dragStart</code></li>\\r\\n    <li><code>drag</code></li>\\r\\n    <li><code>dragOver</code></li>\\r\\n    <li><code>dragEnd</code></li>\\r\\n    <li><code>dragLeave</code></li>\\r\\n    <li><code>dragEnter</code></li>\\r\\n    <li><code>drop</code></li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<code-example>{{ mouseActions }}</code-example>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Shift+Click (Alt / Ctrl)</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If you want to perform actions based on modifier keys, use <code>$event.shiftKey</code>, <code>$event.ctrlKey</code> etc., provided on the third callback argument - <code>$event</code>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Keyboard events</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In keyboard events, the <code>TreeNode</code> parameter of the callback is the currently focused node. In case no node is focused, this will be <code>null</code>.</p>\\r\\n<p>The attributes for <code>actionMapping.keys</code> are integers which represent the key code (e.g. 32 for Space)</p>\\r\\n<p>Angular Tree Component exposes a <code>KEYS</code> constant with predefined common key codes:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<code-example language=\\\"json\\\">{{ keys }}</code-example>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>So you can use those, or pass any keycode you'd like.</p>\\r\\n<p>For example:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<code-example>{{ keysExample

The header and the tree itself. The header is responsible for displaying the column header.\\r\\n  This is needed to give the tree the grid style. If you just want the tree to have columns without any header you don't need to build a header.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>#treeNodeWrapperTemplate</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n  To show the tree in columns it's not needed to use the full templating option. But at least the <code>treeNodeWrapperTemplate</code> is needed.\\r\\n  See also the <a [routerLink]=\\\"['/', 'fundamentals', 'templates']\\\">Template Fundamentals</a>.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Column definition</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n  The example uses a simple array <code>columns = ['city', 'zipCode']</code> to handle the columns.\\r\\n  This array includes the property names that should be shown as columns and does not include the name, which is the first column.\\r\\n  The name is handled differently as seen in the example. The columns array is just looped over and shown.\\r\\n  In a more advanced example you could have the columns array as an input and also handle the name dynamically.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n\";","import { Component } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { TreeModel, TreeNode } from 'angular-tree-component';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-filter',\r\n  templateUrl: './filter.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./filter.component.scss']\r\n})\r\nexport class FilterComponent {\r\n\r\n  options = {\r\n    useCheckbox: true\r\n  };\r\n  nodes = [\r\n    {\r\n      name: 'North America',\r\n      children: [\r\n        { name: 'United States', children: [\r\n            {name: 'New York'},\r\n            {name: 'California'},\r\n            {name: 'Florida'}\r\n          ] },\r\n        { name: 'Canada' }\r\n      ]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      name: 'South America',\r\n      children: [\r\n        { name: 'Argentina', children: [] },\r\n        { name: 'Brazil' }\r\n      ]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      name: 'Europe',\r\n      children: [\r\n        { name: 'England' },\r\n        { name: 'Germany' },\r\n        { name: 'France' },\r\n        { name: 'Italy' },\r\n        { name: 'Spain' }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  ];\r\n\r\n  filterFn(value: string, treeModel: TreeModel) {\r\n    treeModel.filterNodes((node: TreeNode) => fuzzysearch(value, node.data.name));\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction fuzzysearch (needle: string, haystack: string) {\r\n  const haystackLC = haystack.toLowerCase();\r\n  const needleLC = needle.toLowerCase();\r\n\r\n  const hlen = haystack.length;\r\n  const nlen = needleLC.length;\r\n\r\n  if (nlen > hlen) {\r\n    return false;\r\n  }\r\n  if (nlen === hlen) {\r\n    return needleLC === haystackLC;\r\n  }\r\n  outer: for (let i = 0, j = 0; i < nlen; i++) {\r\n    const nch = needleLC.charCodeAt(i);\r\n\r\n    while (j < hlen) {\r\n      if (haystackLC.charCodeAt(j++) === nch) {\r\n        continue outer;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    return false;\r\n  }\r\n  return true;\r\n}\r\n","import { Component, ViewChild } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { ITreeOptions, TreeComponent, TreeNode } from 'angular-tree-component';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-crud',\r\n  templateUrl: './crud.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./crud.component.scss']\r\n})\r\nexport class CrudComponent {\r\n\r\n  @ViewChild('tree') tree: TreeComponent;\r\n\r\n  nodes = [\r\n    {\r\n      name: 'root1',\r\n      children: [\r\n        { name: 'child1' },\r\n        { name: 'child2' }\r\n      ]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      name: 'root2',\r\n      children: [\r\n        { name: 'child2.1', children: [] },\r\n        { name: 'child2.2', children: [\r\n            {name: 'grandchild2.2.1'}\r\n          ] }\r\n      ]\r\n    },\r\n    { name: 'root3' },\r\n    { name: 'root4', children: [] },\r\n    { name: 'root5', children: null }\r\n  ];\r\n\r\n  options: ITreeOptions = {\r\n    displayField: 'name',\r\n    useVirtualScroll: false,\r\n    nodeHeight: 25,\r\n    allowDrag: false,\r\n    allowDrop: false\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  selectedNode;\r\n\r\n  onActivateNode(event: any) {\r\n    this.selectedNode = event.node.data;\r\n    // Do stuff with selected node\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  copyNode(node: any, tree) {\r\n    const parentNode = node.realParent ?
